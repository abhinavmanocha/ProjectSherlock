# Project Sherlock

The Forensics Department at Trent University instructs students in multiple different disciplines geared toward each one becoming forensic analysts. These students currently use a web based program called Sherlock for their studies of blood spatter analysis. This type of analysis consists of examining a distribution of stains within an impact area in order to determine where, in a 3D volume, an object came into contact with a blood source. This analysis is typically performed to help reconstruct the events which occurred within a crime scene. 

Unfortunately, not all crime scenes have open wi-fi available. An Android and iOS app would allow for students to perform their analysis at the crime scene itself, rather than waiting to do so back at the lab. 
## Purpose: 
Developing a flexible blood spatter analysis application that allows students to easily conduct the blood droplet analysis measurements and augment them in a 3D space. 
## Advantage: 
The application will allow students to input their BSA data points to determine area of origin.Students will have an easier and efficient mode of transportable technology to conduct the blood spatter analysis. 
## Measurement: 
Success of this system will be decided by the accuracy of the application while conducting calculations offline. Further indicators of the system performance will be the dependability of the software when operated by many users at the same time.
